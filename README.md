Based on the chart it appears that majority of the rides (over 95%) were rented out for less than an hour with about 50% of the rides for 5 mins. This chart helps conclude that majority of the people rent bikes to travel very short distances which could reached in less than an hour.
 
 2) Check out time by Gender : With the help of this chart, we can easily conclude that though there are way more men who take citi bike rentals, both men and women checkout bikes for approximately the same amount of time.
 
 3) Trips by weekday per hour : A heatmap was created based on the trip start time to understand at which time of the day and which day of the week was the demand for bikes the highest. This chart would help plan bike maintenance and also help the company ensure that more bikes are available during the peak hours.8 AM - 9 AM and 5 PM - 7 PM Monday through Friday had the highest demand for bikes.11 PM to 5 AM would be the ideal time to plan for bike repairs, any events requiring bikes. 10 AM - 5 PM on Saturdays and 12 PM to 5 PM on Sundays were the peak hours during the weekend.
